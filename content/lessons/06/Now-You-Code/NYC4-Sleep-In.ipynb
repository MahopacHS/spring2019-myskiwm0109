Our criteria will be as follows.\n\n- Is it the weekend? Then sleep in.\n- Is it a holiday? Then sleep in.\n- Otherwise you need to get up!\n\nLet's write a program to input the day of the week and ask whether or not its a holiday, then make the appropriate decision as to whether or not we should sleep in.\n\nWe will use the **Write - Refactor - Test - Rewrite** approach to complete the final solution which will refactor the day of the week logic into a function."

Why did we need to write 7 tests?\nOne for each day of the week\n3. Which code is easier to understand? Step 1 or step 4? Why? or Why not? \nStep 1 because you can see all of the code and nothing is hidden\n4. What happens when you input `'sat'` for `'Saturday'` Does it work? How can the program be improved? Does improving it affect the readability of step 4? (HINT: Abstractions!!!)\nIt does not work. You can make a function for holiday and this would make it less code to read in step 4"
