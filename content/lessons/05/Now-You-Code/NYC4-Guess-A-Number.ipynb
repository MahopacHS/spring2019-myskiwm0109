Whenever you guess, the computer will\ngive you a hint of higher or lower. This process repeats until you guess\nthe number, after which the computer reports the number of guesses it took you.\n\nFor Example:\n\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10...\nYour guess: 5\nToo low. Guess higher.\nYour guess: 7\nToo high. Guess lower.\nYour guess: 6\nYou guessed it in 3 tries.\n\nYour loop should continue until your input guess equals the\ncomputer generated random number.\n\n### How do you make Python generate a random number?

A definite loop is a loop where you know the exact number of iterations prior to entering the loop and an indefinite loop is where you don't know the exact number of iterations before entering the loop.\n2. Modify this program to allow you to guess a number between 1 and 100. How much of your code did you need to change to make this work? \nI just needed to add one 0 to the 10 in the print line and the random number generator line.\n3. This program is a good example of a difficult problem to conceptualize which has a simple solution when you look at actual lines of code. I assume you did not write this in a single try, so explain where you got stuck and describe your approach to overcoming it.\nI put in two elif's and then realized later that I should try using just if's and that worked. Other than that everything else I got on my first try."
