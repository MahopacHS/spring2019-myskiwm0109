What are the advantages to storing the number of days above freezing and below freezing in a Python dictionary?\nSo you have a place where it is stored permanently and you can change the values whenever you want.\n2. What is the data type of the weather data as it is read from the file `NYC4-syr-weather-dec-2015.json` ?\nstring\n3. Could this same program work for weather at other times in other cities? What conditions would need to be met for this to happen?\nNo, you would need the weather information for the other location"
